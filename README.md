# Unified Naming Convention

## Overview
The Unified Naming Convention repository outlines the standardized guidelines for naming conventions across different projects to ensure consistency, readability, and maintainability in development.

These guidelines cover:
- Variable Naming
- Function & Method Naming
- Class & Object Naming
- File & Directory Naming
- Other essential elements

## Why a Naming Convention?
Maintaining a unified naming convention helps ensure that:
- Code is easier to read, understand, and maintain.
- Different team members can seamlessly collaborate on the same project.
- Bugs and issues are easier to spot due to consistent naming patterns.
  
## Guidelines

### 1. **Variables**
- **Camel Case:** Use camelCase for variable names.
  - Example: `userInput`, `playerScore`
- Avoid single-character variables unless in loops (e.g., `i`, `j`).
  
### 2. **Functions & Methods**
- **Camel Case:** Functions and methods should use camelCase.
  - Example: `calculateScore()`, `updatePlayerStats()`
- Use verbs to name functions to clearly indicate actions.

### 3. **Classes**
- **Pascal Case:** Class names should use PascalCase.
  - Example: `PlayerCharacter`, `GameSession`
- Class names should represent what the object is or does.

### 4. **Files**
- **Kebab Case:** Use kebab-case for file names to improve readability.
  - Example: `player-stats.js`, `game-session.html`
- File names should describe the contents or purpose of the file.

### 5. **Directories**
- **Kebab Case:** Directory names should also use kebab-case.
  - Example: `assets`, `scripts`, `game-data`
  
### 6. **Constants**
- **All Upper Case with Underscores:** Constants should be written in upper case with words separated by underscores.
  - Example: `MAX_HEALTH`, `DEFAULT_PLAYER_SPEED`
  
### 7. **Other Naming Rules**
- Avoid abbreviations unless they are widely accepted (e.g., `UI`, `ID`).
- Use meaningful and descriptive names.
- Keep names concise but clear.
